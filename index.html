                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>Baseball has been a part of my life for almost as long as I can remember. In fact, as my mother tells me, I was taken to a Cardinals game while I was still in the womb, so in reality I've had baseball be apart of my life even before that!
                This webpage will be dedicated towards the telling of baseball as it pertains to my life, from my early beginnings as a player, my favorite team, and how it still impacts me today. Hopefully by the end of reading this page
                you will have a better idea of what baseball means to me.

                    <p class="Main-Body">As said in the introduction, baseball has been a part of my life even before I was born. While neither of my parents would be considered as a "huge" fan of sports in general, they became fans of the St. Louis Cardinals
                        shortly after moving to St. Louis before I was born. After my birth, I have faint memories of either watching the game on television or listening to Mike Shannon on the radio, it was not until I was ready for elementarty
                        school when I first became directly involved with baseball. As with many kids, my first experience with the game was in t-ball, and my love for baseball only grew from there. I can remember as a kid playing a game in
                        the middle of the day and coming home to see if McGwire had hit another homerun, and then letting my imagination run wild as I played out imaginary games while throwing a bouncy ball against the wall. As I grew older,
                        I joined summer and fall leagues every year, playing as much baseball as I could while I chased my dream of becoming a Major League Baseball Player. While this is probably the aspirations of a lot of children at that age,
                        there was one driving force that fueled my desire to reach the highest levels possible in baseball.

                    <h2>The Team of Dreams, The St. Louis Cardinals</h2>

                    <p class="Main-Body">Having been born and raised in St. Louis, it was only natural that the team I would gravitate towards would be the Cardinals. The most storied franchise in the National League, a great history of players and
                        managers that would intermingle with the cities history, and they only played half an hour away from where I lived? It was match made in baseball heaven, and no sooner had I learn about the relationship between
                        a big mac and Big Mac, I embarked on a life long journey of fandom. At the time, I had no idea the meaning of the phrase "tainted history" or what a "PED" was, but as a young fan, all I knew was throwing the ball
                        was cool and hitting a homerun was cooler, so growing up admist the steroid era was something that only helped to wrap my life around a sport and team. It certainly did not hurt that the Cardinals fielded a historic
                        run of great teams year in and year out throughout my childhood, so even when steroids slowly became taboo, my interest in baseball and the Cardinals held strong. During the beginning of my eight grade year, the Cardinals
                        made an improbable run towards their first World Series Championship in over two decades, and they did the same during my first semester of college. These two events happened to revolve around big life events of my own
                        and these victories were nearly a ralling cry of sorts in my own life, infusing these momentous occassions into my own history as I feverently cheared for my team and city. That, however, was more about the past,
                        what about baseball and the present day?

                    <p class="Main-Body">Today, things have changed since when I first picked up my first baseball. I like to pretend that I'm a grown adult, but reality still shows that I am a 26 year old man. It's been nearly eight years since I've last
                        played in a game, and the initial granduer of our nation's pastime that once captured a younger version of myself has long passed. However, baseball still has a large impact on my life, even in adulthood. After leaving for
                        college, I had decided that baseball was no longer something that I would actively partake in, at least in the sense of playing competitively, but I still followed the sport and the Cardinals as I had my entire life. Far before
                        that point, baseball had become an integral part of my identity, and it was almsot as if my inner self would not function if baseball were not a part of my life in some facet. Perhaps that is a tad bit hyperbole, but I feel no
                        shame in having a simple game mean so much to me. When I went through tough times the past several years, the one constent that helped to keep my grounded was baseball. Whether I was having a good day, or a bad one, I could always
                        rely on the Cardinals playing another game. Life moved on, and so does baseball, and so did I. While the Cardinals have had their ups and downs the past few years, and baseball has recently come under scandals not before seen in the
                        sport, it still helps keep me going even today. This, of course, is not to say that I am entirely dependant on baseball, but it is something that truly helps me course through the trials of life.
                    </p>
                    <p id="Conclusion">In conclusion, baseball is something that I've cherished from my early beginnings, and through my love and adoration for the hometown Cardinals, baseball is still something that impacts my everyday life. Even during this time of
                        national crisis, there is still baseball interweaving itself throughout our society, whether it be the hope procured from our favorite players, to the help they are providing to the community, or even the prospect that it will return
                        when we perservere through this pandemic. I can only hope that there are people out there that have something that positively impacts them the way baseball has me, and that these words have not led anyone to question my sanity. Jokes aside,'
                        baseball will forever be a part of me, and I can only say that I'm happy my parents thought to take me to a game, even before I could possibly be aware of it. <br><br>
