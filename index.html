                <p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>

                <p>Baseball has been a part of my life for almost as long as I can remember. In fact, as my mother tells me, I was taken to a Cardinals game while I was still in the womb, so in reality I've had baseball be apart of my life even before that!
                This webpage will be dedicated towards the telling of baseball as it pertains to my life, from my early beginnings as a player, my favorite team, and how it still impacts me today. Hopefully by the end of reading this page
                you will have a better idea of what baseball means to me.
